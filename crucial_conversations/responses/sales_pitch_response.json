However, the speech included unnecessary filler words such as 'like', 'um', you know', which detracted from the overall clarity and professionalism.

Practicing the pitch more could help in establishing a smoother flow and appearing more confident."},{"speaker":"C","conversation_score":90,"conversation_score_reason":"C did a great job in asking insightful questions to understand the product better.

Effective and clear communication is key, and reducing filler words would help to maintain professionalism and impact."}]}
